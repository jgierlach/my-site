Welcome to Mary Warrick's personal website!!

I have built this site on top of create-react-app.  With this project I am exploring typography and front-end testing. 

O-----> ABOUT ME <----O

I am a full stack web-developer with an emphasis on the front-end.  Formerly a chef, I bring a strong work ethic, adept communication skills, strong attention to detail, the ability to perform under pressure, creativity, vision, and experience leading diverse teams.  

I fell in love with software development when I was working in San Francisco.  On the first night of an intro to computer programming course at Hackbright Academy, I felt like I had been granted entrance to a secret society, and I never looked back.  

I graduated from Fullstack Academy of Code in 2018, and I am currently a teaching fellow for the program.  Mentoring and leading new crops of engineers has been a deeply rewarding experience for me.  

I am currently seeking opportunities for my post-fellowship life.  I want to work with firms that focus on creating, growing, or revitalizing digital products and experiences.  I am a humble team-oriented person, and have the ability to work with many different types of people.

Looking forward to chatting with you!

-Mary
