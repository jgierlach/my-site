  description: "Code Map is a website for organizing and sharing coding resources.  We tracked our data with the graph database Neo4J.  Using a graph database gave us the power to generate recommendations to our users based on ratings and/or recommended sequences.  Myself and one teammate were responsible for learning and implementing Neo4J, so I became very familiar with this exiting data model.  In addition, I was also involved in the full stack of this project.  Building a project from the ground up taught me about planning and scalability.  ",

  description: "For this project, myself and two teammates designed a fully operational e-commerce site for candy.   We used node, express, and sequelize on the backend.  On the front end we used react, redux, and Semantic UI for styling.  As my first major coding project I learned a great deal about git work-flow, testing and using Travis for continuous integration, and kanban-style agile development. ",
